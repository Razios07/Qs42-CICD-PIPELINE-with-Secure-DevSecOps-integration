QS 42
Secure CI/CD Pipeline with DevSecOps Integration
This repository contains a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline designed to automate the build, test, security scanning, and deployment of a Python Web Application.

This pipeline emphasizes DevSecOps principles by shifting security left—integrating secret detection and vulnerability scanning directly into the CI workflow before deployment occurs.
